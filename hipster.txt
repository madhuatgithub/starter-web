Prometheus is another popular solution for collecting Kubernetes metrics, with several tools, frameworks, and APIâ€™s available for using it.

Since Prometheus does not have a Heapster sink, you can use InfluxDB and Prometheus together for the same Grafana instance, collecting different metrics, whenever each one is easier to collect.
